# Project Name: Pacman Game in Windows GUI

**Description:**
Designed and implemented a classic Pacman game entirely from scratch using C and the Windows API. This project showcases the development of a fully functional 2D game with a graphical user interface (GUI), highlighting expertise in low-level graphics programming and game design.

**Key Features:**
- **Custom Graphics Rendering:** Created the game board and all graphical elements (Pacman, demons, walls, and food) using the Windows API and GDI. Developed custom drawing routines for textured walls and colorful game elements without relying on external graphic libraries or image files.
- **Randomized Game Elements:** Engineered a board generation algorithm that places walls, demons, and food randomly, ensuring each game session offers a unique challenge.
- **Movement and Collision Detection:** Implemented game logic for Pacman's movement and interaction with game elements. Managed collision detection between Pacman and walls or demons to handle game-over scenarios.
- **Game State Management:** Designed a system to track and display the score, food count, and game results, including win and game-over conditions, using Windows message boxes for user feedback.
- **From Scratch Implementation:** Developed the game engine and graphical rendering components entirely in C, utilizing the Windows API for window management and input handling without third-party libraries.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Graphics API:** Windows GDI
- **System API:** Windows API for window management and input handling

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Comprehensive use of Windows API and GDI for custom graphics and user interface design
- Development of game logic and collision detection algorithms
- Creation of a randomized environment for dynamic gameplay
- Handling of user input and game state management in a GUI-based application
